When you're out of office or on vacation, you can assign a **Vacation Delegate** to approve reports on your behalf. Domain Admins can also assign delegates for other domain members.

A **Vacation Delegate** steps in to approve expense reports sent to you while you're away. Once assigned, reports awaiting your approval will be forwarded to your delegate. You can disable the delegate when you return.

Expensify keeps a **detailed record** of all approvals made by a delegate, ensuring transparency.

## FAQ

### Why can’t my Vacation Delegate reimburse reports they approve?
If your delegate needs to **reimburse** reports while you're away, they must have access to the reimbursement account. Without this access, they can approve reports but won’t be able to reimburse them.

### What if my Vacation Delegate is also on vacation?
Your delegate can assign **their own** Vacation Delegate. This ensures reports continue to be approved, even if multiple people are out.
