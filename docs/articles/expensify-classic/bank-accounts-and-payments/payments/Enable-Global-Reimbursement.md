# What is Global Reimbursement?

Global reimbursement allows companies to send payments to employees in different countries using Expensify. Once your business bank account is verified and connected, employees can add their international deposit-only accounts and receive payments directly.

**Note:** Each country has its own requirements for identity verification, compliance, and onboarding. Use the guides above to ensure you're submitting the correct documentation.
