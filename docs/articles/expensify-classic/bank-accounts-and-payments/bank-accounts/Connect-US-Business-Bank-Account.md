# Connect a Verified Business Bank Account

## Who can use a verified business bank account

To connect a verified U.S. business bank account: 
- The business must be based in the U.S.
- The person connecting the account must enter their own U.S.-issued ID, SSN, and address.
- The person adding the account doesn’t need to be an account signer.

## Requirements for connecting a verified business bank account

- The company address must be in the US
- The controlling officer (the member initiating the connection to the bank account)'s address must be in the US
- The controlling officer must have a U.S.-issued Social Security number

**Important:** The person adding the bank account doesn’t need to be an account signer but they must enter their own personal information when connecting the bank account. If another person enters their details, the account will be flagged for review, delaying verification.

## Where to find verified business bank account settings

- **Web:** Go to **Settings > Account > Wallet > Bank Accounts**
- **Mobile:** Tap the hamburger menu in the top-left corner, then tap **Settings** > **Account** > **Wallet**

**Step 2: Wait for documentation review**

In some cases, Concierge may request additional documents (e.g., business address verification or a bank letter). If this happens, Concierge will follow up directly.

**Step 3: Watch for the micro-transaction message**

Once your account is nearly ready, you’ll see the message: **“Your bank account is almost set up!”**

This means Expensify has sent **three test transactions** (usually arriving within 1–2 business days). You’ll need these to complete setup.

**Step 4: Validate the test transactions**

Once the test transactions arrive:

1. On the web, go to **Settings > Account > Wallet > Bank Accounts**
2. Click **Enter test transactions**
3. Input the three amounts exactly and click **Validate**

Once validated, your bank account is ready to use.

# FAQ

## What’s the difference between a deposit-only and a verified bank account?

A deposit-only account only receives invoice payments. A verified account can also reimburse employees, pay bills, and fund the Expensify Card.

## Can I verify a deposit-only account later?

Yes! Head to Settings > Account > Wallet, then click Verify next to the deposit-only account to begin the verification process. 

## How long does bank verification take?

It typically takes 1–2 business days to receive the test transactions after seeing the “Your bank account is almost set up!” message. Once you enter those amounts, your account is ready to use immediately.

## Can someone else enter their info when I add the bank account?

No. The person entering the information must provide their own ID, SSN, and U.S. address. If someone else enters their info, the account will be flagged and delayed.
