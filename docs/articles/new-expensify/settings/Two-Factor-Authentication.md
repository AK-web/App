Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) makes your account more secure!!! It adds an extra step to login and helps protect your financial data from hackers. This uses a code generated by an authenticator app.

### How it works

After entering your login email and magic code, the system will ask for a 6-digit verification code. You can get this from your authenticator app. Each code is time-based and changes often, ensuring that no code is ever reused. If it expires, just open the app to get a new one.

### Enable 2FA in Expensify

1. Go to Account > Security in the menu
2. Click on Two-Factor Authentication
3. Follow the steps to enable it
4. Save your backup codes - these are important for account recovery!
   - Click Download to save codes to device
   - Click Copy to paste codes somewhere safe
5. Click Continue
6. Open your authenticator app and connect it by:
   - Scanning QR code, or
   - Entering setup code manually
7. Enter the 6-digit verification code and click Verify

#### What happens when logging in

Once it's enabled, logging in requires two steps:
1. Enter the magic code sent to your email
2. Open your authenticator app and enter the 6-digit verification code. It refreshes often, so use the most recent one available

#### Recovery Codes

Backup recovery codes let you log in if you lose access to your authenticator app.

Each recovery code works like a one-time password. You'll get several unique codes when setting up 2FA - make sure to:

• Store them in a safe, offline location (such as a secure document or password manager)
• Never share your codes with anyone
• Use each code only once - after it's used, it becomes inactive

If you lose your authenticator app and don't have access to your recovery codes, you'll need to contact support to verify your identity and regain access.

# Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why should I use 2FA?

2FA significantly reduces the chance of unauthorized account access, even if someone obtains your login email or password. It's a simple but powerful tool for protecting sensitive financial data.

#### What happens if I lose my phone or uninstall the authenticator app?

Log in using one of your backup recovery codes. Then, disable this and set it up again with your new device or app.

#### Can I use 2FA on more than one device?

Yes! When setting up 2FA, you can scan the QR code with multiple devices (like your phone and tablet) to generate codes from both.

#### What if my verification code isn't working?

Make sure your device's clock is set to the correct time. Authenticator apps rely on time-based tokens, so an inaccurate device clock can cause errors.
