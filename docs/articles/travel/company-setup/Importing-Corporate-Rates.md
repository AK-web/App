## How to import corporate rates into Expensify Travel

To import corporate hotel rates:

1. Contact your **Account Manager** or message **Concierge** if you don't have one.
2. Provide the following:
   - **Hotel name**
   - **Name and email** of your main contact at the hotel
3. Expensify will reach out to the hotel (with you cc'd) and request that your corporate rates be added to the Global Distribution System (GDS) used by Expensify Travel.
4. Once the hotel confirms the rates are uploaded, Expensify will enable them for use in your company’s travel bookings.

You’ll be notified when your corporate rates are active.

## Who should I contact to start the process?
Reach out to your Account Manager or message Concierge. We’ll help you get started.

## How long does it take for rates to be available?
It depends on how quickly the hotel uploads the rate to the GDS. Once confirmed, activation is fast on Expensify’s side.
