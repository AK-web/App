## Why add a payment card?

Adding a personal or company credit card up front means you won’t have to enter your payment details each time you book. The cards you add will be available at checkout and charged directly when you finalize your travel reservation.

If your card is also connected to your Expensify account, the travel expense and receipt will automatically merge the travel receipt into the card expense automatically.
