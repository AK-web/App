## How assisted trip fees work

It’s always free to reach out with questions. You’ll only be charged a fee if a travel agent books or changes a trip for you.

Here’s a breakdown of the fees:

- **Self-serve trip (booked or changed on your own):** $15
- **Assisted trip (booked or changed by a travel agent):** $25
- **Already paid $15 for self-serve, but then ask for agent help?** You’ll only be charged the additional $10 difference

Once you’ve paid the $25 assisted trip fee, you can keep getting help on that trip as many times as needed — no extra charges.

**Note:** The fee only applies once per trip, no matter how many changes are made by the agent.

# FAQ

## Will I be charged for asking questions?

Nope! You can contact travel agent support anytime to ask about pricing, availability, your itinerary, or general travel questions — it’s totally free unless an agent actually books or changes your travel.

---

## What if I already paid $15 and then need help?

If you start with a self-serve trip ($15), and later ask travel agent support to modify it, we’ll charge the difference — an extra **$10** — to bring the total to **$25**.

---

## Can I keep asking for help after I pay the $25 fee?

Yes! Once a trip becomes an assisted trip, you can contact travel agent support as many times as needed for that trip without paying more.

---

## What’s the difference between the $15 and $25 trip fees?

If you book or change travel yourself, the fee is **$15 per trip**.

If you ask travel agent support to do it for you, the fee is **$25 per trip**. This covers unlimited agent assistance for that trip, including any changes later on.
