### [react-native-tab-view+4.1.0+001+fix-tab-animation.patch](react-native-tab-view+4.1.0+001+fix-tab-animation.patch)

- Reason: 

    ```
    This patch addresses an issue where the camera in IOURequestStepScan fails to render due to the current position value
    from react-native-tab-view not updating during tab transitions. It explicitly trigger a re-render when the active tab or page changes.
