name: 'Check Pull Request Synchronize Changes'
description: |
  Detects actual file changes in PR synchronize events, avoiding false positives from merged commits.
  
  This action is specifically designed for pull_request synchronize events where you need to distinguish 
  between actual changes pushed to the PR versus changes that came from merging the base branch.
  
  For simple file change detection in PRs, use `gh pr diff --name-only <pr_number>` instead.
  
  Use this action when you need to:
  - Trigger workflows only when specific files are actually modified in the PR (not just merged from main)
  - Avoid false positives when main is merged into a PR branch
  - Perform line-level comparison between push changes and PR changes
