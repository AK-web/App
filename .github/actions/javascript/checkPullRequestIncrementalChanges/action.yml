name: 'Check Pull Request Incremental Changes'
description: |
  Detects actual file changes in PR opened or synchronize events, ignoring false positives from merge commits.
  
  This action is specifically designed for pull_request synchronize events where you need to distinguish 
  between actual changes pushed to the PR versus changes that came from merging the base branch.
  
  For simple file change detection in PRs, use `gh pr diff <pr_number>` instead.
