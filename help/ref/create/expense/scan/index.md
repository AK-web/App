# Scan Receipt

Expensify's receipt scanning technology automatically extracts expense details from your receipts, making expense entry fast and accurate.

## How Receipt Scanning Works

Simply take a photo or upload an image of your receipt, and Expensify will:
- **Extract the amount** and currency
- **Identify the merchant** name and location  
- **Detect the date** of purchase
- **Categorize the expense** based on merchant type
- **Apply workspace rules** automatically
