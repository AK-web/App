# Distance Expense

Create mileage expenses using Expensify's built-in mapping.

## How to Create

1. Click the **+** button and select **Create expense**
2. Choose **Distance** 
3. Enter your **Start** and **End** locations
4. Add stops if needed
5. Click **Next** and choose your workspace
6. Review distance, amount, and date
7. Click **Create expense**

## How Rates Work

**Submitting to a workspace:** You'll choose from distance rates enabled by your workspace admin.

**Personal tracking:** Expensify applies default rates based on your currency (e.g., current IRS rate for USD).

## Tips

- Recent locations appear for quick selection
- For round trips: enter the same start/end location with stops in between
- Distance unit (miles/km) depends on workspace settings
