# Distance Expense

Create mileage expenses for business travel using Expensify's distance tracking and calculation features.

## When to Use Distance Expenses

Distance expenses are perfect for:
- **Business trips** in your personal vehicle
- **Client visits** and meetings
- **Commuting** between work locations (not home to office)
- **Delivery or pickup** for business purposes
- **Any business travel** where you're using your own vehicle

## Creating a Distance Expense

### Setting Your Route
- **Start location**: Enter your starting address or use current location
- **End location**: Enter your destination address
- **Stops**: Add multiple waypoints for complex trips
- **Route options**: Choose the most accurate route taken

### Automatic Calculations
Expensify will automatically:
- **Calculate total distance** using mapping data
- **Apply your workspace mileage rate** 
- **Convert to expense amount** (distance Ã— rate)
- **Account for tax implications** if configured

## Mileage Rates

### Workspace Rates
Your workspace admin sets mileage rates based on:
- **IRS standard rates** (updated annually)
- **Custom company rates** 
- **Vehicle type** (car, motorcycle, etc.)
- **Geographic region** if rates vary by location

### Current Rates
- Check your workspace distance rate settings
- Rates are typically per mile or per kilometer
- May include separate rates for different vehicle types

## Required Information

- **Business purpose**: Why was this trip necessary?
- **Date and time**: When the travel occurred
- **Category**: Assign to appropriate expense category
- **Route accuracy**: Verify the calculated route matches your actual path

## Tips for Accuracy

- **Use exact addresses** for more precise calculations
- **Add stops** if you made multiple business-related stops
- **Record immediately** while the trip is fresh in memory
- **Include business purpose** - Required for tax compliance
- **Keep odometer records** as backup documentation

## Tax Considerations

For business mileage:
- **IRS compliance**: Follow current deduction guidelines
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of business purpose
- **Personal vs. business**: Only claim legitimate business miles
- **Commuting rules**: Regular home-to-office commuting is typically not deductible
