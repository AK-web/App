# Personal Bank Accounts

Add your personal bank account to get reimbursed or paid — no paper checks, no waiting around. Expensify supports banks in over 190 countries.

## Adding a Personal Bank Account

1. Go to **Settings > Wallet > Bank Accounts**
2. Click **Add Bank Account**
3. Select your **country** from the dropdown
4. Connect with **Plaid** (for banks located in the U.S.) or enter your details manually

## What You Can Do

- **Get reimbursed** for expense reports
- **Receive invoice payments**
- **Use multi-currency support** to get paid in your local currency

**Heads up:** Personal accounts are for receiving funds only. If you want to send payments or issue Expensify Cards, you’ll need to connect a verified business bank account.
