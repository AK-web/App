# Workspaces 101

Think of a workspace as mission control for your company’s expenses. It’s where you set the rules, invite the team, and connect to your accounting tools. Each workspace runs independently, so you can keep things tidy across departments, entities, or clients.

## Create a new workspace
Hit the green + button next to Workspaces in the left-hand menu. Pick a name and your default currency, and you’re ready to get started!

## Invite your team
Add teammates to your workspace to manage expenses and approvals in one central place:
- Members can submit and approve reports they’re assigned to.
- Admins can approve all reports and manage workspace settings.

## Automate approvals
Turn on Add Approvals under Workflows to set a default first approver. 

## Connect your accounting system
Link your workspace with QuickBooks Online, Xero, NetSuite, or Sage Intacct to sync expenses like a pro.

## Enhance your workspace with extra features
Under **More Features**, enable extras like Expensify Cards, mileage tracking, custom categories and tags, and company card feeds.

**Tip:** If you manage multiple departments, clients, or entities, creating multiple, separate workspaces can help organize settings, people, and integrations.
