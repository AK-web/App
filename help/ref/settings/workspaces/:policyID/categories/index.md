# Workspace Categories

Categories help organize and classify expenses for better reporting, budgeting, and accounting integration. Every expense should be assigned to a category.

## What are Categories?

Categories represent different types of business expenses, such as:
- **Travel** - Flights, hotels, rental cars, meals
- **Office Supplies** - Equipment, software, stationery  
- **Marketing** - Advertising, promotional materials, events
- **Professional Services** - Legal, consulting, accounting fees
- **Meals & Entertainment** - Business meals, client entertainment

## Setting Up Categories

### Default Categories
New workspaces include common business categories:
- Office Supplies
- Travel
- Meals
- Professional Services
- Equipment

### Custom Categories
Create categories that match your business needs:
1. Click "Add category" or + button
2. Enter a clear, descriptive name
3. Configure category settings (optional)
4. Save your new category

### Category Settings
For each category, you can configure:
- **Description hint** - Guidance for users on what belongs in this category
- **GL Code** - For accounting system integration  
- **Default tax rate** - Automatically apply tax rates
- **Receipt requirements** - Require receipts over certain amounts
- **Approval rules** - Route to specific approvers
- **Spending limits** - Flag amounts over thresholds

## Managing Categories

### Editing Categories
- Update names to keep them clear and current
- Modify settings as business needs change
- Add codes for accounting integration

### Archiving Categories
Instead of deleting categories:
- Archive unused categories to hide them
- Historical expenses keep their original categories
- Can be unarchived if needed later

### Category Rules
Set up automatic rules to:
- **Auto-categorize** based on merchant names
- **Require descriptions** for certain categories  
- **Flag large amounts** for review
- **Route approvals** to department heads

## Import and Export

### Importing Categories
- **CSV upload** - Bulk import from spreadsheets
- **Accounting sync** - Import from QuickBooks, Xero, etc.
- **Copy from template** - Use industry-standard category lists

### Exporting Data
- Export category reports for analysis
- Download lists for offline reference
- Share with accounting teams

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- **Be specific** - "Software Subscriptions" vs. "Subscriptions"
- **Stay consistent** - Use similar naming patterns
- **Avoid duplicates** - "Travel" and "Business Travel" cause confusion
- **Keep it simple** - Users should easily understand what belongs

### Organization
- **Group related categories** - Use prefixes like "Travel - Hotels", "Travel - Flights"
- **Limit the number** - Too many categories overwhelm users
- **Regular cleanup** - Remove unused categories periodically
- **Train your team** - Ensure everyone understands which category to use

### Integration
- **Match accounting codes** - Align with your accounting system
- **Consider reporting needs** - Structure for the reports you need
- **Tax compliance** - Set up categories for tax reporting requirements
