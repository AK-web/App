# Reports Page

The Reports page helps you explore, filter, and take action on all your reports and related expenses. It complements the Inbox by giving you a complete view of your expense history.

## Expenses

- **Managing expenses**: Click on any expense row to see its details in a side panel. Use checkboxes to select multiple expenses, then use bulk actions like Move, Download, or Delete from the action menu.

- **Filters**: Looking for something specific? Use filters to narrow things down by date, category, merchant, tag, workspace, or report status. You can also combine filters with keywords for even more precise results.

## Reports

- **Sort reports by status**:
      - Draft – Only you can see it
      - Outstanding – Waiting on someone else
      - Approved – Ready to pay
      - Done or Paid – All wrapped up

- **Download what you need**: Generate a report to download filtered expense data as a CSV. Perfect for spreadsheets, monthly close, or syncing with accounting.

## Chats

- **Viewing report previews**: Each report preview shows up right in your workspace chat with the status, up to 10 expenses, and buttons like Submit or Approve, depending on your role.

- **Filter chats:** Use filters to find the exact chat you're looking for.
