# Categories

Categories help you organize expenses so your reports and accounting stay clean and easy to manage. Think of them as your chart of accounts or GL codes. You can add them manually or import them straight from QuickBooks, Xero, and other accounting software.

- **Smarter categorization, automatically:** Expensify learns how you tag your expenses and starts automatically applying those categories to similar merchants. This means less busywork and more accuracy.

- **Category settings made simple:** You can toggle categories on or off, add GL codes, and set rules like receipt requirements or spending limits, all in one place.
