# Preoptimizing Philosophy
This philosophy guides our approach to optimization by focusing on proven problems rather than hypothetical issues across all aspects of development and processes.

#### Terminology
- **Preoptimizing** - Optimizing a solution before identifying actual problems
- **Premature optimization** - Adding complexity to solve issues that may not exist
- **Bottleneck** - A confirmed point in the process that limits overall efficiency
- **Measuring** - Collecting actual data about process performance or outcomes

## Rules

### - Optimizations MUST be based on measured problems
Do not optimize processes or solutions unless you have:
- Identified a specific problem through user reports, metrics, or observation
- Measured the issue with appropriate tools or data collection
- Confirmed the optimization target is actually a bottleneck

### - Solutions SHOULD prioritize simplicity over theoretical efficiency
When implementing new processes or solutions, prefer:
- Clear, understandable approaches
- Standard methodologies and practices
- Simple workflows and procedures
- Straightforward execution paths

Optimizations can be added later if and when they become necessary.

### - Optimizations MUST be measured before and after implementation
When implementing process improvements:
- Establish baseline measurements before optimization
- Implement the optimization
- Measure the actual improvement gained
- Document the results achieved


## When TO Optimize

### - User-reported issues
When users report that processes are slow, confusing, or inefficient in specific scenarios.

### - Metrics indicate problems
When monitoring shows:
- Increased completion times
- Higher error rates
- Resource bottlenecks
- User satisfaction declining
