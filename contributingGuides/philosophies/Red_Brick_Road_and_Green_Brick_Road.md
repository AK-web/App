# Red Brick Road and Green Brick Road Philosophy
The Red Brick Road (RBR) and Green Brick Road (GBR) are each a method to direct a user down a clear path of actions to take or errors to fix. It is intended to help the user have a clearly defined set of steps to follow in order to resolve something.

Any chats in the left hand navigation (LHN) that require attention due to either the Red Brick Road or Green Brick Road will in most cases show up in the highest context chat.

## Green Brick Road (GBR)
Generally, the GBR shows up when there is a pending action to take or item to review.
For example:
- There is a report pending approval by an admin
- There is a report pending submission by an employee
- There is a report waiting to be paid by the admin
- There is a report queued for reimbursement but the employee needs to add a deposit bank account
- An Expensify Card has been issued to an employee but the employee needs to add their shipping details
- A user is mentioned in a report comment


## Red Brick Road (RBR)
Generally, the RBR shows up when there is an error or violation that needs fixing. 
For example:
- There are violations on a report that the employee needs to fix
- There is a task that you assigned to an employee waiting to be completed
- There is an expense that the admin put on hold
- Your accounting integration connection is broken
- Your direct connection to your bank or Plaid is broken and needs to be reconnected
- There is an error with your billing subscription
