## Prerequisites
Before jumping into the code, you SHOULD know or brush up on:

1. The major difference between React Native and React are the [components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) that are used in the `render()` method. Everything else is exactly the same.
2. The application uses [`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org/) for navigating between parts of the app.
